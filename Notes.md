**HTTP2**

HTTP/2 is a major update to the HTTP protocol that improves web performance by allowing multiple requests to be sent over a single connection, compressing headers, and enabling server push. These features reduce latency and enhance the efficiency of data transfer. Additionally, with HTTP version 2.0, servers send you the resources you need before you ask for them, like images or files. All of these improvements work together for faster web performance and a silky-smooth online experience.
While HTTP/1.1 used plain text for communication, HTTP v2 employs a binary protocol, allowing for more efficient parsing and faster data transmission. The binary format reduces the amount of data that needs to be transmitted, improving performance.
HTTP/2 offers a feature called weighted prioritization. This allows developers to decide which page resources will load first, every time. In HTTP/2, when a client makes a request for a webpage, the server sends several streams of data to the client at once, instead of sending one thing after another. This method of data delivery is known as multiplexing. Developers can assign each of these data streams a different weighted value, and the value tells the client which data stream to render first.

**Key Features of HTTP/2**

  **1. Server Push**
  
  One of the notable features of HTTP/2 is server push. With it, the server can proactively send resources to satisfy the client’s future requests.      This feature reduces the number of round trips required between both – the client and server, resulting in faster page load speed.

  **2. Multiplexing**
  
  HTTP/2 uses multiplexing to allow multiple concurrent requests and responses over a single TCP connection. Unlike HTTP/1.1, where each request had     to wait for a response before the next request could be sent, HTTP/2 enables parallelism. Thereby improving overall efficiency. With multiplexing,     requests, and responses are divided into smaller units called frames. These frames are then interleaved and sent in a non-blocking manner. This        means that if one request is delayed due to network congestion, other requests can continue to be processed.

  **3. Flow control and Stream Prioritization**
  
  HTTP/2 introduces the concept of stream prioritization, which allows the client to assign priority levels to different resources. This, along        with flow control, ensures that critical resources are fetched first, optimizing the rendering of web pages and providing a better user experience.

  **4. Header Compression**

  HTTP/2 utilizes a header compression mechanism (HPAC) to reduce the overhead associated with HTTP headers. This compression technique reduces the size of the headers, resulting in lower bandwidth consumption and faster communication between the client and server.

  **Performance Benefits of HTTP/2**
  
The adoption of HTTP2 brings significant performance benefits. Combining features such as server push, multiplexing, stream prioritization, and header field compression results in faster page load times, reduced latency, and improved web performance. Websites and applications using HTTP/2 often experience better user engagement and increased conversion rates.

**Compatibility and Adoption**

HTTP2 is designed to be backward-compatible with HTTP/1.1, ensuring that existing web infrastructure can seamlessly transition to the latest protocol. Most modern browsers and servers support HTTP/2, allowing website owners and developers to take advantage of its benefits without major compatibility issues.
